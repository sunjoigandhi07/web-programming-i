    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    Love is Blind is a reality dating show that tests if love is truly blind.
    For ten days, a bunch of single people from the same city date each other
    but never actually see one another. They spend hours in these pods talking
    and connecting and at the end of day ten, couples decide if they want to
    spend the rest of their lives together and get engaged. After they get
    engaged, only then are participants able to see the partner they have chosen
    to marry. Once they are revealed, the couples go on vaction before moving
    back to the city they live in. The couples begin living together as a test
    run before they get married at the end of the experiment. The entire show is
    filmed in 38 days, meaning these people meet and decide if they want to get
    married only knowing one another for slightly over a month.

    <h2>My thoughts?!??!</h2>
    This show is nuts. Like what..?? Getting married after only knowing each
    other for like a month and not even seeing each other until the end of week
    2 of talking. And getting engaged before you even physically meet someone?
    No thanks. I do however, love how messy this show. Though not as messy as
    recent reality dating series, this show is seriously broken. There is always
    jealously, resentment, and honestly a surprising amount of love lol.
    <p>
      Season 1 had a lot more success than season 2 but season 2 is WAY more
      interesting and intriguing than season 1. Plus, the cast in season 2 is
      way more diverse. Out of all the reality dating tv I watch, which is
      clearly too much, season 2 of Love is Blind has the best representation
      I've seen. Now let's rank the couples who got married at the end of the
      experiment-
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th rowspan="4">Got Married</th>
        <td>1. Cameron and Lauren</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. Barnett and Amber</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. Jarrett and Iyanna</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. Nick and Danielle</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Hmmm... though 4 couples have gotten married in the 2 seasons, only 2
    couples remain together. Cameron and Lauren and Barnett and Amber are both
    season 1 couples and they are the only two couples that are still together.
    All season 2 couples broke up and have gotten with other cast members or
    other people. Honestly, season 1 was not as entertaining as season 2 so I am
    going to focus on that. Here is a list of couples from season 2 and why I
    think they shouldn't be with each other-

    <dl>
      <dt>Deepti and Shake</dt>
      <dd>
        OMG, thank god these two didn't get married. What a disaster. Shake is
        lowkey the worst person ever. Like first of all, being super icky in the
        pods asking about appearances like bro do you even know the whole point
        of the show?? And I was so excited to see an Indian couple and to see
        brown people in love on tv but man he was a jerk. When he compared her
        to an Indian auntie, it was over.. like there is no coming back from
        that and I hope his crusty ass is happy with a white woman because he
        clearly has internalized racism he needs to work through.
      </dd>
      <dt>Natalie and Shane</dt>
      <dd>
        Honestly, this couple caught me off guard. I was not expecting to like
        them but during the show, I loved them. Their ending was intense thoooo.
        Like I wouldn't marry someone who told me they hated me the night before
        our wedding. I also think Natalie is WAY to good for Shane and looking
        back now, super glad they didn't get married. Shane has the crazy eyes
        and how close he was the Shaina..? Not cool because she was also lowkey
        racist to Natalie and Shane did not do enough to stand up for Natalie.
      </dd>
      <dt>Iyanna and Jarrett</dt>
      <dd>
        I definetely thought these two would last.. or at least I hope they
        would. This is another Deepti and Shake moment where we get to see
        people of color being represented and in love but the guy sucks. Iyanna
        was super sweet and cute and I hope she finds happiness but Jarrett
        lowkey didn't realize how great she was. Like when he had to talk about
        why she is so special he said it was her resiliency.. like what a shitty
        answer. Anyways, they just got divorced so they lasted longer than
        expected.
      </dd>
      <dt>Mallory and Salvador</dt>
      <dd>
        Yikes.. this one was brutal. He was super into her but she was not that
        into him and it is a good thing they didn't end up together. You could
        tell during their first meeting that she was not feeling him but they
        stayed together until the wedding. Big red flag for me is him not
        getting Mallory a gold ring.. like I would not be cool if my partner
        didn't know simple things about me like the type of jewelry I prefer.
        They were lowkey boring and were just a filler couple for me.
      </dd>
      <dt>Danielle and Nick</dt>
      <dd>
        Hmmm.. this was a weird one. I thought they were cute until Danielle
        started acting lowkey crazy, and this is not one woman tearing another
        one down... she was like actually making the most wild, unhinged choices
        and freaking out about nothing. Also, Nick cannot be 100% straight..
        like sir be honest with yourself. Anyways, I did not expect them to get
        married but they did.. and now they are getting divorced.. which I did
        expect.
      </dd>
