    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    Keeping Up With the Kardashians follows the lives of ridiculously rich
    people in California. We keep up with five sisters and their mom/manager
    Kris as they navigate being super famous. The show includes family
    vacations, messy love lives, and a deep dive into how these influencers make
    an immense amount of money. KUWTK ran for 20 seasons on E! Network and the
    family has now transitioned into recording their lives for more money on
    Hulu instead.

    <h2>Now let's get into my thoughts...</h2>

    Honestly, the Kardashians are everything that is wrong in this world.. but I
    love them. They are stupid rich and as someone who cannot even fathom having
    the amount of money they have, I love watching the show. They live in a
    world so out of touch with reality and its fascinating to see what is normal
    to them. Plus, watching the show takes no brain power in any capacity
    because its just a bunch of white women spending money, crying, and
    fighting. I have seen every season of Keeping Up and now am actively
    watching their new show, which is the exact same show with better music and
    they probably make even more money somehow. Because this family is famous
    for being famous and living life for the public, I thought I would rate some
    of the events from the show. Let's start with Khloe and Tristan-

    <table>
      <caption>
        <h3>Times Tristan Thompson Cheated on Khloe (worst to less worse)</h3>
      </caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Order</th>
        <th>Cheating Scandal</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Cheating on Khloe when she was 9 months pregnant</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>
          Cheating on Khloe and getting another woman pregnant and hiding it for
          months, while trying to have another baby with Khloe
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>
          Cheating on Khloe with Kylie's best friend Jordan, who is
          significantly younger
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    Yikes... not looking good for Khloe. Like I get it, he is 6'7" and hot but
    girl, the first time he cheated, days before you gave birth, should've been
    enough to end it for good. Anyways, you live and you learn right? And if
    they get back together for a fourth time, Khloe, I can't defend you anymore
    and your choices.

    The family trip to Bali was actually the first episode I had ever seen of the show. 
    After that episode, I was hooked and watched, honestly WAY too much TV about 
    this random family. Before watching that episode, I had never really cared about 
    the Kardashians and I didn't really know anything about them. Don't worry though, 
    this show helped me learn a lot of useless information about famous people I will 
    never meet so.. 
    <br /> 
    <p>
      
    
    Now, we can move on to the new show, called "The Kardashians" (I know how original). 
    Not much has happened in the season and a half of the newest Kardashian show. However, 
    a lot of drama has been going on with the family and here is a list of things I want to 
    see more of on the show as if anyone cares about my recommendations- 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travis Scott and the concert scandal</li>
      <li>Kim and Pete's PR relationship</li>
      <li>Scott and his breakdown over Kourtney's happiness</li>
      <li>The family's reaction to Kanye and his internet presence lately...</li>
    </ul>

      Thanks for reading my ramble of thoughts on a family that's famous for no reason, 
      come back for more thoughts on season 2 of The Kardashians!
