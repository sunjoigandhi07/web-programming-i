    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      The term “Asian American” encompasses a diverse population of people with
      origins in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia living in the United
      States. Asian Americans account for 7% of the US population, approximately
      23 million people. As the fastest growing minority group, the Asian
      population is projected to surpass 46 million by the year 2060. A majority
      of the Asian American population is composed of individuals from China
      (5.4 million), India (4.6 million), the Philippines (4.2 million), Vietnam
      (2.2 million), Korea (1.6 million), and Japan (1.5 million). Out of the
      10.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the US, Asian Americans make up
      approximately 14% of that population. The presence of Asians in the US is
      increasing significantly and steadily (Budiman 2021). With the recent wave
      of anti-Asian rhetoric surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been
      an increase of education regarding Asian history in the US. Most high
      school curriculums do not even teach Asian history, despite Asians being
      in the US for hundreds of years. In order to get a better understanding of
      Asian history, we need to look at how and when Asians came to the US. More
      specifically, who did the US let in from Asia. Legislation like the
      Chinese Exclusion Act and the Asian Exclusion Act prohibited large groups
      of people from migrating to America. As a result, those who were eligible
      to immigrate influenced how society viewed individuals from specific Asian
      countries. Once Asians settled in the US, court cases for their right to
      naturalize shifted what category Asians fell into. Legislation and court
      history has led to ideas such as the model minority myth, forever
      foreigner, the over sexualization of Asian women, etc. By analyzing the
      legislation, we can see its effects on stereotypes and misconceptions
      immigrants and their children face today.

    <h4>Asian Immigration Legislation and Its Repercussions</h4>
    <p>
      Before the more commonly known Chinese Exclusion Act came the Page Act of
      1875, which prohibited laborers, specifically Asian women, from coming to
      the US due to their “lewd and immoral purposes” (Rotundi 2021).
      Essentially, the Page Act attacked Asian women for being seen as
      promiscuous and prostitutes. The act considered people from East Asia
      migrating to the US as forced laborers and imposed a fine of $2,000 and a
      jail sentence of one year on anyone who tried to bring Asian women to the
      US without their voluntary consent. Asian women who voluntarily attempted
      to enter the US at the Angel Island Immigration Station were subject to
      medical exams considered “barbarous, humiliating, and discriminatory. The
      sharp decline in Asian women migrating to the US is partly due to Asian
      women choosing to avoid those kinds of exams and interrogations. The Page
      Act was one of the first restrictive immigration laws in the US and put an
      end to open borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese Exclusion Act or the Immigration Act of 1882 was one of the
      first and only major legislation at the time to explicitly suspend
      immigration for a specific nationality. The act, signed by President
      Chester A. Arthur, prohibited all Chinese laborers, skilled or unskilled,
      from entering the country as well as Chinese laborers employed in mining
      (Wu 2021). Additionally, it prevented Chinese individuals who left the US
      from returning. The Page Act barred entry to Asian women while the Chinese
      Exclusion Act barred entry to all Chinese men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original act was put in place for ten years but was later extended for
      another ten years by the Geary Act (1892). The Geary Act required
      individuals of Chinese origin to carry identification certificates with
      them at all times or risk deportation. Besides that, it limited people of
      Chinese origin’s access to bail and only allowed immigration entry to
      teachers, students, diplomats, and tourists. At this point, the Chinese
      Exclusion Act has been implemented for twenty years. In 1902, Congress
      extended the act for another ten years, and eventually made the act
      indefinite in 1904. In San Francisco Bay, Chinese immigrants would be
      detained for weeks, months or even years before being granted or denied
      entry at the Angel Island Immigration Station.
