      The term “Asian American” encompasses a diverse population of people with origins in
      East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia living in the United States. Asian Americans
      account for 7% of the US population, approximately 23 million people. As the fastest 
      growing minority group, the Asian population is projected to surpass 46 million by the
      year 2060. A majority of the Asian American population is composed of individuals from 
      China (5.4 million), India (4.6 million), the Philippines (4.2 million), Vietnam 
      (2.2 million), Korea (1.6 million), and Japan (1.5 million). Out of the 10.5 million 
      unauthorized immigrants in the US, Asian Americans make up approximately 14% of that 
      population. The presence of Asians in the US is increasing significantly and steadily 
      (Budiman 2021).

      With the recent wave of anti-Asian rhetoric surrounding the Covid-19 
      pandemic, there has been an increase of education regarding Asian history in the US. Most 
      high school curriculums do not even teach Asian history, despite Asians being in the US 
      for hundreds of years. In order to get a better understanding of Asian history, we need to
      look at how and when Asians came to the US. More specifically, who did the US let in from
      Asia. Legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Asian Exclusion Act prohibited
      large groups of people from migrating to America. As a result, those who were eligible
      to immigrate influenced how society viewed individuals from specific Asian countries. 
      Once Asians settled in the US, court cases for their right to naturalize shifted what 
      category Asians fell into. Legislation and court history has led to ideas such as the 
      model minority myth, forever foreigner, the over sexualization of Asian women, etc. By 
      analyzing the legislation, we can see its effects on stereotypes and misconceptions immigrants
      and their children face today.

      Before the more commonly known Chinese Exclusion Act came the Page Act of 1875, which prohibited 
      laborers, specifically Asian women, from coming to the US due to their “lewd and immoral purposes”
      (Rotundi 2021). Essentially, the Page Act attacked Asian women for being seen as  promiscuous and
      prostitutes. The act considered people from East Asia migrating to the US as forced laborers and
      imposed a fine of $2,000 and a jail sentence of one year on anyone who tried to bring Asian women 
      to the US without their voluntary consent. Asian women who voluntarily attempted to enter the US
      at the Angel Island Immigration Station were subject to medical exams considered “barbarous,
      humiliating, and discriminatory. The sharp decline in Asian women migrating to the US is partly 
      due to Asian women choosing to avoid those kinds of exams and interrogations. The Page Act was one
      of the first restrictive immigration laws in the US and put an end to open borders.

      The Chinese Exclusion Act or the Immigration Act of 1882 was 
      one of the first and only major legislation at the time to 
      explicitly suspend immigration for a specific nationality. The 
      act, signed by President Chester A. Arthur, prohibited all 
      Chinese laborers, skilled or unskilled, from entering the country 
      as well as Chinese laborers employed in mining (Wu 2021).
      Additionally, it prevented Chinese individuals who left the US 
      from returning. The Page Act barred entry to Asian women while the
      Chinese Exclusion Act barred entry to all Chinese men. The original 
      act was put in place for ten years but was later extended for another 
      ten years by the Geary Act (1892). The Geary Act required individuals 
      of Chinese origin to carry identification certificates with them at
      all times or risk deportation.

      Besides that, it limited people of Chinese origin’s access to bail and 
      only allowed immigration entry to teachers, students, diplomats, and 
      tourists. At this point, the Chinese Exclusion Act has been implemented
      for <em> twenty years. (example of absolute positioning)</em>
