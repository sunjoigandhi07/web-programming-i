Hello and welcome back to my reality tv site.
I used Javascript various times throughout the website
for user's to see what time of day it is, what day it
currently is (to know when new episodes of these shows
are released), get alerts, click to see hidden html elements, etc.
I used for loops and if/else statements to accomplish several things,
like iterating over an array with my favorite stars from paticular shows
and writing that to the page.If/else statements became very useful 
in relaying information of the date and time. Hiding HTML elements 
was useful in creating suspense for users, especially when seeing 
my ratings for certain moments throughout the excessive amount of
seasons some of these shows have. An alert pops up for the user after 
they have submitted the form on the homepage, to ensure they 
know their opinions matter and were submitted.
