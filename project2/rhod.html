    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    The Real Housewives of Dubai follows the lives of 6 insanely rich women living in Dubai. We
    see their family lives, professional lives, and personal lives. Most of the time, they are 
    fighting about something ridicuous and there is lots of yelling, crying, and drinking. They wear 
    fabulous outfits and spend most of their time throwing parties for their friends to attend. 
    
    
    <h2>My thoughts-</h2>
    I have never watched any of the Real Housewives shows but this one got me. It has a cast of 
    primarily women of color and only one white woman which I love. Plus, the white woman is the first 
    and they all shit talk her, which she has earned. During the reunion, it was revealed she is in 
    Epstein's book... like we aren't gonna talk about that an cancel her??? Anyways, they are all super 
    rich and spend money on random things. They all compete about who is more famous or successful 
    or whatever and it is so mind numbing its perfect. No thoughts when I watch this show lol.

    Order of how much I like each housewife- 
   <p id = "favorites"></p>
    
    <!-- for loop in javascript to list an array -->
    <script> 
        const wife = ["1. Lesa", "2. Sara", "3. Nina", "4. Ayan", "5. Caroline B", "6. Caroline S"];
        var txt = ""; 
        for(var i = 0; i < wife.length; i++) {
          txt += wife[i] + "<br>"; 
        }
      document.getElementById("favorites").innerHTML = txt; 
    </script>
    
    This is a newer Real Housewives series but there are so many other ones you should check out! 
    (Link uses random to display 2 different links)
    <p id= "random"></p>
    
    <!-- Using math.random in javascript to display links --> 
    <script> 
    let text; 
      if(Math.random() < 0.5) {
        text = "<a href= 'https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills'> Visit RH of Beverly Hills </a>"; 
      } else {
        text = "<a href= 'https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county'> Visit RH of Orange County </a>"; 
      }
      document.getElementById("random").innerHTML = text; 
    </script>
