Hello and welcome back to my reality tv site.
CSS helped me elevate my website to be more pleasant visually. 
I changed the background color of every page, edited the header font 
for every page, added a menu to visit the other pages to every page, 
and added margins to certain paragraphs for emphasis. I utilized a flexbox 
to have all the pictures and names of the reality tv shows to be on one axis
on the home page. I also made the buttons, made to show hidden information
bright and fun to press. WooHoo!
